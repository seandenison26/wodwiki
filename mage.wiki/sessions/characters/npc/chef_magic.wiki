		


	A French awakened chef who works their magic into food, Life/Matter/Entropy? Very alchemical, but with taste. Oh shit, maybe an ecstatic? Reads Tea leaves and what not. Even collects bowel movements. Gastronomically inclined? Literally is collecting chamber pots of nobles to determine their detiny's? 
	
	Very few hard measurements when it comes to cooking and rare if ever do you see find recipes from books, it's mostly chef's sharing with other chefs.
	
	Seer of Cronos Baker, has exceptional taste, deliberately lets rye break mold because he sees things from the visions.
