	Island is filled with hawks. 
	Portugese claim to have found the islands completely empty, save for a number of birds, yet the fields were 
	Given as Dower to the Duchess of Burgundy, Margaret of York, and were colonized with Flemings. Colonists were more concerned with profit than governments and quickly viewed the King of Portugal as their Master. 
	St. Micheal is the largest island and would be the seat of the Bishop
